    "# Experiment Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We are conducting an experiment to analyze how subjects decide whether the provided answer to arithmetic problems is correct or incorrect. The experiment includes both simple and moderately challenging arithmetic problems. The hypothesis is that solving more difficult problems will elicit different pupil responses compared to simpler problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subjects and Task\n",
    "Four subjects participated in the task. Each subject was presented with an arithmetic problem displayed on the screen, followed by a suggested answer. The subjects then responded by pressing the 'f' key if they believed the answer was incorrect, or the 'j' key if they believed the answer was correct. The objective is to measure the accuracy and response time in relation to the difficulty of the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eyetracker Integration\n",
    "To monitor the different stages of each trial, we sent specific messages to the eyetracker, which are embedded within the eyetracker data. These messages help in segmenting the data according to the phases of the trial. The sequence of phases and corresponding messages used in OpenSesame is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start Trial: Initiated with the message \"start_trial\".\n",
    "1. Baseline Phase: Marked with the message \"baseline\".\n",
    "1. Problem Presentation: Indicated by the message \"problem\".\n",
    "1. Fixation Phase: Marked by the message \"fixation\".\n",
    "1. Response Phase: Denoted by the message \"response\".\n",
    "1. Feedback Phase: Signified by the message \"feedback\".\n",
    "1. End Trial: Concluded with the message \"stop_trial\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection\n",
    "For each trial, the following data points are recorded:\n",
    "\n",
    "Difficulty: The level of difficulty of the arithmetic problem (simple or more difficult).\n",
    "Response: The key pressed by the subject ('f' or 'j').\n",
    "Correctness: Whether the subject's response was correct or incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "This detailed data collection allows us to analyze the relationship between problem difficulty, pupil response, and the accuracy of the subject's answers."
